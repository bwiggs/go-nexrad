# The Archive 2 File Format

> The following is an excerpt from the `ICD for the Archive II User` document.

### 7.3.6.1.1 LDM Raw Data File Format

To exploit the Archive II data the end user must develop a program to extract and decompress the bz2 data stored in the LDM raw data file. Once decompressed each message requires 2432 bytes of storage with the exception of Message Type 31 (Digital Radar Data Generic Format) which is variable length.

#### 1. Volume Header Record
The first record in the file is the Volume Header Record, a 24-byte record. This record will contain the volume number along with a date and time field.

#### 2. LDM Compressed Record

This second record is bzip2 compressed. It consists of Metadata message types 15, 13, 18, 3, 5, and 2. See section 7.3.5. This is all related to radar site status.

The first LDM Compressed Record contains the Archive II messages comprising the Archive II metadata. 
The size of the uncompressed metadata is fixed at 134 messages, ie. 325888 bytes. 
The following table contains the message types in the sequence in which they are placed in the LDM Compressed Record.  
It contains the number of 2432 byte message segments set aside for each message type when they are uncompressed. 
In those instances where the message requires fewer segments than indicated the message type field of the excess message segments will be set to zero.  

Starting with Build 19, Message type 13 will not be included in the Metadata Record. The space reserved for this message will be filled with zeros.

#### 3-N. LDM Compressed Record

A variable size record that is bzip2 compressed. It consists of 120 radial data messages (type 1 or 31) plus 0 or more RDA Status messages (type 2). 

The last message will have a radial status signaling “end of elevation” or “end of volume”. See paragraph 7.3.4. Repeat (LDM Compressed Record) Or End of File (for end of volume data) 

### Message Types

| Message Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
|Message 2|RDA Status Data, contains the state of operational functions|
|Message 3|RDA Performance/Maintenance Data|
|Message 5|RDA Volume Coverage Pattern|
|Message 13|RDA Clutter Filter Bypass Map|
|Message 15|RDA Clutter Map Data|
|Message 18|RDA Adaptation Data|
|Message 31|Digital Radar Data Generic Format|
